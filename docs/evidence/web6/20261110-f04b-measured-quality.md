# WEB6 F04b — regression gates and measured-quality disposition

**Date:** 2026-11-10 (Asia/Bangkok). **State:** FRONTEND REGRESSION PASS; LIVE LOAD/RECOVERY BLOCKED / NOT RUN / NOT MEASURED.

## Frontend gates at `9eb7d37`

Windows, Node `22.14.0`, npm `11.6.0`, Playwright `1.64.1`. Commands ran serially in the isolated frontend worktree.

| Gate | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm.cmd ci` | PASS; 419 packages added, 420 audited; 6 advisories retained (2 low, 4 moderate), no package mutation. |
| `npm.cmd run typecheck` | PASS. |
| `npm.cmd run test:unit` | PASS; 80 files, 1,517 tests, 0 failed. |
| Ordinary `npm.cmd run build` | PASS; 2,579 modules; ordinary resend OFF. Existing chunk warning: main JS 2,419.79 kB / 680.28 kB gzip. |
| Ordinary production Playwright, one worker | PASS; 2 discovered/executed/passed, 0 failed/skipped/retried. These are artifact-isolation/default-OFF tests with controlled browser routes, not the live pilot pack. |
| Ordinary `dist` deterministic tree digest | `b2422fdce8d0b8645a3f6213952ce2b4c6bff288c0c8a217ed655b70be93ce88`. This is not a candidate-enabled artifact hash. |

No scenario-row count is added to the browser-test count. The three cutover specs and three manual-resend specs were statically discovered during implementation, but were not executed against the backend candidate and therefore are not PASS evidence.

## Backend-linked quality disposition

- Backend workload code requires all six mutation classes and four supporting classes, bounded attempts toward 1,000 observations/class, p50/p95/p99, error/timeout/CPU/RAM/SQL lock/session/journal measurements, PR #95 re-admission and no retry. The exact selector was BLOCKED before allocation, so `F6-LOAD-01` is **NOT RUN / NOT MEASURED** and no percentile, throughput, capacity or SLA statement exists.
- Backend recovery code implements a real source-host interruption, protected backup into a distinct owned restore, epoch/principal rotation, Task2/PR #95 admission, stale 409 zero-effect checks, authenticated HTTP Sales Create/Update/Post and a full physical oracle. The exact selector lacked the accepted Task4 receipt and complete candidate inputs, so `F6-REC-01` is **BLOCKED / NOT RUN** and no RPO/RTO value is claimed.
- Backend verification retained failed attempts and owned resources when cleanup certainty was absent, including two fresh SQL runs from an initial permission-preflight defect. Later fresh green tests do not erase or authorize cleanup of those retained runs.
- A full backend Security project PASS is not claimed: an earlier overlapping destructive-suite attempt was aborted and later scoped affected gates were used. Frontend regression PASS cannot replace backend SQL/IIS/browser acceptance.

Ordinary manual resend remains OFF. Pilot enablement requires a separately accepted live pair and explicit Owner decision. Staging remains NOT ACCEPTED; production remains NO-GO / DEFERRED.
